# COMSM0049: Systems & Software Security (S3)

The [System & Software Security Unit](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=21%2F22&unitCode=COMSM0049) at Bristol is assessed either through [exam](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=21%2F22&unitCode=COMSM0050) XOR [coursework](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=21%2F22&unitCode=COMSM0051).
The exam option is worth 10 credits and the coursework option 15 credits.
As per [university guidelines](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/programme-design/) "one credit point represents approximately 10 notional hours of student input".

As per appropriate for a master-level unit, students are expected to work independently outside of lectures and labs.
Hence, reading materials and exercises are provided alongside labs and lectures.
Students (especially those on the coursework option) are **very strongly encouraged** to do this work diligently during the first 7 weeks of the term.
Students will struggle to complete their coursework on time if they haven't engaged with the unit material beforehand.

## Reading Material

This is a fourth year, master-level unit, so a significant amount of independent work is expected from students.
The objective of the unit is to familiarise students with important security topics, but also to familiarise students with academic research.
Beside enhancing the understanding of the subject, this will provide an opportunity to have a taste of exciting research in the field of security.
Those papers are available on the unit website and it is recommended that students read those papers.
To make the most out of this exercise, please, check how to [read](papers/keshav2007.pdf) and [review](papers/roscoe-2007.pdf) technical papers.
