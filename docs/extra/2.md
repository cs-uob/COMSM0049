## Exercises

1. Explain what is meant by an arena, a heap, and a chunk and how they
  relate? (5 marks)




2. To defend against use after free attacks, Alice has the following
  macro defined:
  
  `#define FREE(x) { free(x); x = NULL; }`
  
  Is that going to be sufficient to stop the vulnerability and why?
  What tradeoffs are being made?  What about compiler optimizations?

3. The [CHERI architecture](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/) is a (really cool) new instruction set
  architecture that makes it impossible to exploit buffer overflows by
  replacing _pointers_ with _capabilities_; that is bounded data
  structures that provide hardware protection against buffer overflows
  by ensuring that all pointers are bounds checked (they're not just
  an address but instead a base address and an offset that defines the
  permissible range, that can't be fiddled with via register
  arithmetic).  Speculate on whether these new capabilities would also
  protect against heap overflow attacks in particular use after free.  
  
...okay maybe that last one would be rather mean for an exam; speculate away and we can discuss in the next lab if anyone is keen!

(also... Microsoft have recently anounced that they'll including support for CHERI primitives in the latest version of Windows; sometimes research really does become *real world* technology!)



## Answers (do not check this before you try to answer the exercices alone)

1. The arena is a block of memory shared between threads of a process which the allocator can allocate from (1).
A heap is an area of memory within an arena that will be divided up by an allocator (1)
Chunks are sections of a heap that are either allocated or free  for allocation (1)

An arena will contain at least one heap (1)
A heap will be divided up into chunks as memory is allocated and freed (1)

2.  
No. (1)

Whilst that will stop (or at least force writes to null) if x is reused in the same function call (1) as soon as x is aliased (ie. passed in a function call or copied) it wont with the aliased call. (1)

Checking that you're not reusing a pointer after you free it is useful in a function and will likely cause an explicit crash now, but this shouldn't give you false confidence that the bug isnt actually present.
In the best case if x really isnt ever used again in that function call the compiler will remove the write to x anyway as a dead write making the whole exercise redundant (1).

This definitely falls into only if youre interested territory, but CHERI is really interesting.
