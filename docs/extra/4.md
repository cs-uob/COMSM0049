## Reading

1. book (Chapter  1, section 1.3):  Fuzzing for  Software Security  Testing and  Quality Assurance. Ari Takanen,  Jared DeMott,  Charlie Miller
2. Godefroid, Patrice. "Fuzzing: Hack, art, and science." Communications of the ACM 63.2 (2020): 70-76.
3. Stephens, Nick, et al. "Driller: Augmenting fuzzing through selective symbolic execution." NDSS. Vol. 16. No. 2016.

5. 
## Exercices:

1. For an unknown input file format, which of the fuzzing types is more appropriate-- mutational or generational (grammar) and why?
2. What are shortcomings of blackbox fuzzing \[hint: what is the proxy metric for a good fuzzer?\]
3. Read the article "Fuzzing: Hack, Art, and Science" [pdf link](https://patricegodefroid.github.io/public_psfiles/Fuzzing-101-CACM2020.pdf) and answer the following questions:
	1. Why fuzzing is more challenging for netwroked/server type applications?
	2. On page 74, 3rd column, it is written "Note that full program statement coverage is a "necessary but not sufficient" condition to find all the bugs in a program.". Can you elaborate this statement why it is necessary but not sufficient?
	3. In general, which fuzzing type is suitable for fuzzing XML and C code parsers/compiler?
