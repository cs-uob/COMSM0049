# Week 6 Homework

As always, skim the lot of the reading, and go into more detail if
there are things you're particularly interested in or which I didn't
explain well in the lecture.  Whilst the required reading isn't going
to necessarily appear _directly_ in the exam, being able to illustrate
any points you make from the core lectures with examples from the
reading or using it to give wider context is **always** going to be
worth a mark or two.

- Go watch _Mark Seaborn_ and _Halvar Flake's_ Blackhat talk about
  Rowhammer: [Exploiting the DRAM Rowhammer Bug to Gain Kernel Privileges](https://youtu.be/0U7511Fb4to) (because primary sources
  are always better than secondary ones `;-)`)
  
- Go _skim_ Google's Project Zero disclosure of the Spectre and
  Meltdown vulnerabilities: [Reading privileged memory with a
  side-channel](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)
  (primary sources _are_ cool and all but there is far more information
  here than you need, especially about branch prediction)
  
  
## Exercises

- Why do you need to flush the cache in order to exploit the Rowhammer
  vulnerability? (5 marks)
  
<!-- Rowhammer works by repeatedly discharging the capacitors -->
<!-- implementing RAM by reading and writing repeatedly (2).  If there -->
<!-- is a cache in the way then the first read will go to the RAM but -->
<!-- subsequent ones will go to the cache (2) Consequently you need to -->
<!-- flush between writes to ensure the write goes to the cache (1) -->

- One approach to mitigating the Spectre and Meltdown attacks is to
  disable symmetric multithreading.  The OpenBSD operating
  system does this by default, and most other operating systems now
  provide a mechanism to do so too.  Alice has their own laptop which
  only they use.  They would rather have the performance boost over
  the increased security.  Are they right? (15 marks)

<!--
There are a lot of arguments you *could* make here.
You could say:

- Alice is the only user on there laptop so its unlikely another user
  may be able to leak her keys specifically.  If they're running servers
  though off their laptop then they might rethink that as the server
  process could be manipulated.

- Alice is a grown up.  If they would prefer speed over security then
  they can make their own choice---if the laptop is just used for junk
  projects then maybe its fine?  But how much performance do they
  really need?  Is not an awful lot more security against an exploit
  path we know gets exploited.  Does word and a webbrowser really need
  100% raw power?
  
- Alice may not be a security expert and may not fully understand the
  implications of a fairly complicated attack; but given the number of
  crypto papers they're in they probably are, and who are we to judge
  them?
  
Ultimately, I *have* re-enabled SMT before, but it is a decision that 
depends on what your workflow is.  If there is any doubt then it 
should be off and remain off (security by default).

Though as Greg Kroah-Hartman said:
