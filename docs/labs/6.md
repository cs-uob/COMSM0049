# COMSM0049: Lab 7: Sandboxing for Security

_Note:_ This weeks lab was written by Jo's former PhD student (and former COMSM0049 TA) *Dr* Maysara Alhindi; and it's based on
his own PhD research!  If this stuff interests you you should talk to
Jo!

When we've been exploiting programs in earlier labs, once we
compromise the program we gain access to _the whole_ system.  This
is silly: we want to ensure that even if a program is compromised it
can't be used to compromise other processes on the system.  Sandboxing
is one family of techniques to start to isolate processes; and protect systems.

There are many different techniques to sandbox programs, some of them
are isolation-based mechanisms such as docker, and some are
application based, such as Linux's `seccomp`, and OpenBSD's `pledge`,
and `unveil`. Application-oriented sandboxes are designed to limit the
process's access to system resources, such as filtering the system
calls that a process is allowed to run, or restricting the files that
a process can read and write to. These mechanisms help in implementing
the least privileged principle, where the process is only given
privileges that are needed to complete its task and nothing more;
reducing the damage in case of compromise. In
this lab, we will be looking at different sandboxing mechanisms,
POSIX `chroot`, Linux's `seccomp` and OpenBSD's `pledge`, and `unveil`.

# Chroot

Chroot is old, it was added to Linux in 1979![^1] chroot stands for
_change root_, this technique was never intended to be used as a
security mechanism, it was created for debugging purposes. Unfortunately, it has been widely used to sandbox programs and still to this day.

Chroot simply works by rebasing the root directory of the sandboxed
process, so if a process is in a chroot sandbox, the process will
think that the root directory of the system is the directory of the
chroot sandbox instead of the actual root directory of the system (/),
and thus, the process can not simply access files outside the sandbox
by using commands such as `cd ..`.   This helps isolate processes from
the surrounding filesystem.

However, since chroot was not designed for security, we can break out!

[^1]: Of course, Linux wasn't around in 1979 (the first release was back in 1991)... but chroot was a part of the System 7 AT&T UNIX and it made its way into the POSIX standards too.--_Jo_

## Material

**Vagrantfile**
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant"
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "sudo apt-get update --yes"
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "sudo apt-get install --yes strace build-essential libseccomp-dev"
end
```

**jailed_process.c**
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dirent.h> 

#define GREEN "\x1B[32m"
#define RESET "\x1B[0m"

void ls(){
  printf("%sCurrent files and directories in /%s\n",GREEN,RESET);
  DIR *d;
  struct dirent *dir;
  d = opendir("/");
  if (d) {
    while ((dir = readdir(d)) != NULL) {
      printf("%s\n", dir->d_name);
    }
    closedir(d);
  }
}

void escape_sandbox(){
  /* TODO: Complete me! */ 
}

int main(){
  escape_sandbox();
  ls();
  return 0;
}
```

This program has `ls` function, which list files in the root directory. 

* Compile this program and run it. Make a note of the files that it lists.

`gcc --static jailed_process.c -o jailed_process`


## Task 1

Let's put this program in a chroot jail and run it there.

chroot command line program takes two parameters, a directory for the chroot jail, and a program to run inside the jail.

```bash
# create the jail directory
mkdir -p jail/home
# copy the program to the jail directory
cp jailed_process jail/home
# run chroot (need sudo)
sudo chroot jail /home/jailed_process
```

* Was the output different from when you run the program outside the jail?
* Can you figure out why we needed to compile the program statically?

## Task 2
 Each process in Linux has two properties, the root directory and the current working directory (cwd). You can examine these directories for the current process as follows:
```bash
ls /proc/$$/cwd
ls /proc/$$/root
```
To change the current working directory of a process, you can use `chdir` system call. 
To change the root directory of a process, you can use `chroot` system call.

**Note**
chroot command line tool is different from chroot system call. chroot command line tool runs chroot system call to change the root directory to the specified jail directory, and **then***, it runs chdir system call to change the cwd to the jail directory. The chroot system call does **not***  change the cwd of the jailed process. (This difference is very important and you will need to understand it to be able to escape chroot jail).

* Use the information above to escape the chroot jail, write your code in `escape_sandbox` function. 

**Hints**
1. To escape the jail, you need to use a combination of `mkdir`, `chroot`, and a number of `chdir` system calls. 
2. Morse code is a fun hobby!  `I I I I I I I` think you'll really
   find it useful for this exercise (escuse my stammer `;-)`).

## Task 3

That's the systemcall version of chroot!  Lets play a bit with the
command line tool too.

First off you need to build a new root filesystem: 

Create a new directory in your VM for the sandbox and populate it with
the minimum stuff for your OS: some programs to run and some libraries
to link against. Then chroot into it!

**It is highly advisable to complete this exercise inside a VM**

```shell
mkdir sandbox
cp -R /usr/ sandbox
cp -R /bin/ sandbox
cp -R /lib* sandbox
sudo chroot sandbox
```

If everything has gone well you should have root inside the minimal
system you just created!

How are you going to break out now?

**Hints**
1. Who are you running as inside your `chroot` sandbox?
2. `exit` your sandbox, and on your host system have a look at the
   output of the `mount` command.  What is mounted on `/`?  If you
   could gain access to that inside your sandbox you could win...
3. Run `ls -l /dev/*`.  What do all the numbers mean?
4. Read `man mknod` and `man mount`

# Seccomp

Seccomp (short for secure computing) is a security mechanism provided
by Linux as a sandboxing technique for processes to limit what system
calls a process can run. Seccomp can be used in two modes, strict
mode, and filter mode, in this lab, we will focus on the filter mode. 

Filter mode allows the filtering of system calls (white listing and
black listing certian system calls) using a configurable policy
implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules (BPF). However, writing
BPF filters is tricky and requires writing assembly code. 

Luckily, there is a library that makes using seccomp much easier! In
this lab we'll use `libseccomp` to sandbox a C program and
allow/disallow certain system calls. Documentation for `libseccomp`
can be found [here](https://libseccomp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Material

**Vagrantfile**

You can reuse the `chroot` one!  Just copying it here in case you skip
a bit!

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant"
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "sudo apt-get update --yes"
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "sudo apt-get install --yes strace build-essential libseccomp-dev"
end
```

**sandbox.c**
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <seccomp.h>

#define GREEN "\x1B[32m"
#define RESET "\x1B[0m"

// ADD YOUR CODE HERE
void create_sandbox(){
  scmp_filter_ctx ctx;
  ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_ALLOW);
  seccomp_load(ctx);
}

void read_file(){
  char buf[6];
  int fd = open("/dev/urandom",O_RDONLY);
  size_t n = read(fd, buf, 5);
  if(n==5){
    printf("Read from /dev/urandom is %sdone%s\n",GREEN,RESET);
  }
  close(fd);
}

void write_file(){
  char* buf = "testing";
  int fd = open("/dev/null",O_WRONLY);
  size_t n = write(fd, buf, 1);
  if(n==1){
    printf("Write to /dev/null is %sdone%s\n",GREEN,RESET);
  } 
  close(fd);
}

void get_process_id(){
  int pid = getpid();
  printf("Current process id is %s%d%s\n",GREEN,pid,RESET);
}

void run_untrusted_code(){
  read_file();
  write_file();
  get_process_id();
  printf("%sProgram finished successfully\n%s",GREEN,RESET);
}

int main(){
  create_sandbox();
  run_untrusted_code();
  return 0;
}
```
This given program writes to a file, reads from a file, and outputs the process Id. In this lab, you will be asked to use different sandboxing mechanisms to limit what this program is allowed to do.

## Task 4
You will be implementing the sandbox in create_sandbox function. Compile the C program and answer the following questions: 

`gcc sandbox.c -lseccomp -o sandbox` 

- What happens when you run the program?
- Use strace to monitor what system calls the program executes.
- What does seccomp_init function do, and what parameters does it take? Use the man pages to find this information `man seccomp_init`.
- What is `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW` parameter?

## Task 5
Let's try to restrict all system calls (prevent the program from running any system call) using seccomp

- Replace `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW` with another parameter to disallow all system calls. Use the help of man pages.
- Use strace to figure out what system call causes the program to crash.

## Task 6
- Use `seccomp_rule_add` function to add a filter rule to allow only read_file and write_file functions to complete successfully.
Use the help of man pages `man seccomp_rule_add`, there are examples at the bottom of the page that will help you.
- Configure seccomp to allow all functions (read_file, write_file, get_process_id) to run successfully.

## Task 7
Let's test what we know so far

- Can we inspect the system call parameters using seccomp? If no, can you figure out why?
- Can we limit access to specific files using seccomp? Why _or_ why not?

# Pledge and Unveil

## Material
  
Linux is boring! Lets try Jo's favourite operating system!  Most
commands are _similar_ but there are some differences.  You may need
to use _su_ or _doas_ instead of _sudo_ for instance.   The package
manager (if you need it) is `pkg_add`.
  
**Vagrantfile**
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "generic/openbsd7"
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant"
end
```

In OpenBSD `pledge` and `unveil` provide similar functionality to
seccomp in Linux. Pledge takes a list of promises, these promises map
to a group of system calls or specific system functionality. On the
other hand, unveil system call is used to restrict process resources
in terms of file system access. A program calling unveil with a
specified path is only allowed to access files under that path.

**Notes:** 
- Before compiling the program, remove any seccomp related code. 
- To compile the program in openbsd run `cc sandbox.c`.
- `strace` is not available in OpenBSD (its a completely different OS
  no matter how similar it looks to Linux), however, there are simillar alternatives, such as `ktrace` and `kdump`.

## Task 8

We will be working with the same program above but this time using pledge and unveil. Remove any seccomp-related code and try to solve the following tasks.

- Use pledge system call to only `read_file` and `write_file` functions to run successfully.
Read the man page of pledge `man pledge` to know which promises to use to achieve the task.

## Task 9
- Use pledge system call to allow all functions in the program to run successfully.

## Task 10
- Use unveil system call to restrict access to only the `/home` folder.
Read the man page for unveil `man unveil`.

## If you play CTFs
I love CTFs, here is an interesting hackthebox machine that involves escaping chroot jail :) [HackTheBox - Scanned ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoQuNsCyQz0)

## Read more about Capsicum
We touched on seccomp in Linux, and pledge and unveil in OpenBSD, however, in FreeBSD, there is capsicum.
Capsicum is another sandboxing mechanism that aims to achieve somewhat similar goals to seccomp and pledge. It combines capabilities with file descriptors (not just files!) to limit the resources a program can access and use.

## Read more about Qubes OS

>  If you're serious about security, QubesOS is the best OS available today. It's what I use, and free. Edward Snowden

Qubes OS is a security-oriented operating system, it uses virtual machines to isolate untrusted code and processes. It uses Linux Xen lightweight virtual machines to isolate process and different environments. If one of these components were to become comprimised, the malicious programme would only be able to access the data present in the comprimise environments.

N.B. Jo wrote his PhD dissertation in Qubes.  It is surprisingly
usable when you get to grips with its weirdness; but it is initially
*very* weird and won't run inside a VM.  

Whilst Jo no longer uses it day to day he has a massive soft spot for
it and would **strongly** encourage anyone to give it a try... it
feels like you're using the future...!

The architecture document is also worth a read: [Qubes OS Architecture](https://www.qubes-os.org/attachment/doc/arch-spec-0.3.pdf).
